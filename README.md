# Web-Mobile-Template-Advance

This is a proof of concept web and mobile template that aims at reusing as much as possible between a web application and mobile application.  The project uses Xamarin.Forms PCL and ASP.NET MVC as the main architectures; however, following the same guidlines it is easily extendable to plugin in any type of UI (Console App, WebForms, WinForms, Windows Phone, etc).  

This project also includes a "Validation Framework" that I created for Xamarin.Forms.  This aims to easily use an MVVM approach in Xamarin.Forms and reuse validation from any other project.
